## 1. Color Palette

Our color palette is defined by a high-contrast combination of a dark, sophisticated background and vibrant, electric accent colors. This creates a visually engaging experience that draws attention to key information and calls to action.

### Primary Colors

- **Electric Blue (Primary)**
  - **HSL:** `187 100% 50%`
  - **Hex (approx):** `#00E0FF`
  - **Usage:** This is the main brand color. It's used for primary buttons, icons, links, and key visual elements like the text gradient. It conveys technology, energy, and trust.

- **Charcoal Black (Background)**
  - **HSL:** `247 4% 10%`
  - **Hex (approx):** `#1A1A1D`
  - **Usage:** This is the primary background color for the dark theme. It provides a sleek, modern, and professional foundation that makes the vibrant primary and accent colors pop.

- **Neon Magenta (Accent)**
  - **HSL:** `338 100% 62%`
  - **Hex (approx):** `#FF3C7E`
  - **Usage:** The accent color is used for secondary calls-to-action, highlights within components, and as a secondary color in gradients. It adds a burst of energy and creates a dynamic visual hierarchy.

### Supporting Colors

- **Foreground:** `hsl(240 8% 97%)` - A soft off-white used for all body text, ensuring high readability against the dark background.

## 2. Typography

The typography is chosen to be clean, modern, and highly legible, reinforcing the futuristic aesthetic.

  - **Weights:** 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 700 (Bold).

- **Body Font: 'Inter'**
  - **Usage:** Used for all paragraphs, labels, and general interface text. 'Inter' is a highly readable sans-serif font designed for screens, ensuring that content is clear and easy to digest.

## 3. UI & Design Principles

- **Layout:** The site uses a responsive, grid-based layout. Content is organized into well-defined sections and cards to create a clear visual structure.
- **Glassmorphism:** The `card-glass` style adds a semi-transparent, blurred background effect to cards, creating a modern, "glass-like" feel that adds depth and sophistication.
- **Gradients:** Gradients (`text-gradient`, `btn-gradient`) are used to combine the Primary and Accent colors, creating a vibrant and eye-catching effect for key headlines and buttons.
- **Animations:** Animations are subtle and purposeful. They are used for hover effects on buttons and interactive elements, adding a layer of polish and engagement without being distracting. The background features a dynamic particle animation that adds to the high-tech atmosphere.
